# Pure Data and Processing 

## Team Members
- Nicole Molineros S.

## Project Description
This project is a data sonification system that visualizes and sonifies the fluctuations of a currency over time using Processing and Pure Data. The goal was to create an interactive experience where the data from a public dataset is not only visualized graphically but also translated into sound, making it easier to perceive patterns and changes in the data through both visual and auditory channels.
## Requirements
- The use of **Processing** for graphical visualization of data.
- The use of **Pure Data** for real-time sound generation and sonification.
- Integration via **OSC (Open Sound Control)** to connect Processing and Pure Data.
- The system must utilize a public dataset to extract historical data on currency fluctuations.
- The visualization and sonification must change dynamically according to the data being processed.
- A video demonstration showcasing the project in action.

## Dataset Used
The project uses historical exchange rate data sourced from a public dataset available on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com). 
The data includes exchange rates over a specified period, which are visualized and sonified.
