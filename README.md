# Pure Data and Processing 

## Team Members
- Nicole Molineros S.

## Project Description
This project is a data sonification system that visualizes and sonifies the fluctuations of currencies over time using Processing and Pure Data. The goal was to create an interactive experience where the data from a public dataset is not only visualized graphically but also translated into sound, making it easier to perceive patterns and changes in the data through both visual and auditory channels.
## Requirements
- The use of **Processing** for graphical visualization of data.
- The use of **Pure Data** for real-time sound generation and sonification.
- Integration via **OSC (Open Sound Control)** to connect Processing and Pure Data.
- The system must utilize a public dataset to extract historical data on currency fluctuations.
- The visualization and sonification must change dynamically according to the data being processed.
- A video demonstration showcasing the project in action.

## Dataset Used
The project uses historical foreign currency rates data sourced from a public dataset available on [Kaggle]([https://www.kaggle.com](https://www.kaggle.com/discussions/general/234811)). 
The data includes currency rates over a specified period, which are visualized and sonified.

## Justification
This project was designed using **Processing** and **Pure Data** due to their flexibility in handling real-time visual and auditory interactions. By leveraging **Open Sound Control (OSC)**, it is possible to establish seamless communication between the data visualization in Processing and the sound generation in Pure Data.
